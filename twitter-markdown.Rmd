## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r old work}
get_tweets <- function(q, geocode){
  temp <- search_tweets2(q = q, n = 15000, include_rts = FALSE, geocode = lookup_coords(geocode), retryonratelimit = TRUE) 
  temp2 <- temp %>%
    select(created_at, text, query) %>%
    mutate(location = geocode,
         eastern_time = with_tz(created_at, tzone = "America/New_York"))
  temp2$new_time <- as.POSIXct(trunc(temp2$eastern_time, "mins"))
  return(temp2)
}

sentimentize_tweets <- function(x, start, end){
  temp <- unnest_tokens(x, "word", text) %>%
    inner_join(get_sentiments("afinn")) %>%
    mutate(time_bucket = round_date(new_time, "5 minutes")) %>%
    group_by(location, time_bucket) %>% summarise(sentiment = sum(score), words = n()) %>%
    mutate(avg_sentiment = sentiment/words) %>%
    filter(time_bucket >= mdy_hms(start, tz = "America/New_York"),
           time_bucket <= mdy_hms(end, tz = "America/New_York"))
  return(temp)
}

city1a <- get_tweets(q = "Bruins OR Leafs", geocode = "Boston")
city1b <- sentimentize_tweets(test, start = "4/25/2018 19:00:00", end = "4/25/2018 23:00:00")
city2a <- get_tweets(q = "Bruins OR Leafs", geocode = "Toronto")
city2b <- sentimentize_tweets(testa, start = "4/25/2018 19:00:00", end = "4/25/2018 23:00:00")
combined <- bind_rows(city1b, city2b)

ggplot(data = combined, aes(x = time_bucket, y = avg_sentiment, group = location)) + geom_line(aes(group = location, color = location)) +
  labs(title = "Twitter Sentiment of Bruins vs. Leafs", subtitle = "Tweets containing 'Bruins' or 'Leafs'", 
       caption = "@AlexNovet", x = "Time (Eastern)", y = "Average Sentiment")+ 
  theme_few()
            
```

Future Steps:

2. Need to clean plotting to include vertical lines for period starts and ends, better theme
3. Add comments
4. Can I limit time of tweets?

TIme is in UTC

How to get game ID? The first 4 digits identify the season of the game (ie. 2017 for the 2017-2018 season). The next 2 digits give the type of game, where 01 = preseason, 02 = regular season, 03 = playoffs, 04 = all-star. The final 4 digits identify the specific game number. For regular season and preseason games, this ranges from 0001 to the number of games played. (1271 for seasons with 31 teams (2017 and onwards) and 1230 for seasons with 30 teams). For playoff games, the 2nd digit of the specific number gives the round of the playoffs, the 3rd digit specifies the matchup, and the 4th digit specifies the game (out of 7).

Future: Add JSON to extract goal times
