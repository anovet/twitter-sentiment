## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r old work}
get_tweets <- function(q, geocode){
  temp <- search_tweets2(q = q, n = 18000, include_rts = FALSE, geocode = lookup_coords(geocode)) 
  temp2 <- temp %>%
    select(created_at, text, query) %>%
    mutate(location = geocode,
         eastern_time = with_tz(created_at, tzone = "America/New_York"))
  temp2$new_time <- as.POSIXct(trunc(temp2$eastern_time, "mins"))
  return(temp2)
}

sentimentize_tweets <- function(x, start, end){
  temp <- unnest_tokens(x, "word", text) %>%
    inner_join(get_sentiments("afinn")) %>%
    group_by(location, new_time) %>% summarise(sentiment = sum(score)) %>%
      filter(new_time >= mdy_hms(start, tz = "America/New_York"),
         new_time <= mdy_hms(end, tz = "America/New_York"))
  return(temp)
}

#plot_sentiment <- function(x, start, end){
#  
#}


test <- get_tweets(q = "Bruins OR Leafs", geocode = "Boston")
test2 <- sentimentize_tweets(test, start = "4/25/2018 19:00:00", end = "4/25/2018 23:00:00")
testa <- get_tweets(q = "Bruins OR Leafs", geocode = "Toronto")
testb <- sentimentize_tweets(testa, start = "4/25/2018 19:00:00", end = "4/25/2018 23:00:00")

combined <- bind_rows(test2, testb)

ggplot(data = combined, aes(x = new_time, y = sentiment, group = location)) + geom_line(aes(group = location, color = location)) +
  labs(title = "Twitter Sentiment of Bruins vs. Leafs", subtitle = "Tweets containing 'Bruins' or 'Leafs'", 
       caption = "@AlexNovet", x = "Time (Eastern)", y = "Total Tweet Sentiment")+ 
  theme_few()
            
```

Future Steps:

1. Average or total sentiment?
2. Need to clean plotting to include multiple labelled regions, vertical lines for period starts and ends, better theme, starts and ends
3. Add comments
4. Can I limit time of tweets?
